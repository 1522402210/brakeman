  <div class="entry-content"><p>A lot of code has changed in this release, particularly with the removal of the Ruport library for reporting. While Ruport worked pretty well, it caused some issues just due to the large number of (out-dated) dependencies it brought with it.</p>

<p>Also, this release changes the JSON report output. This is a backwards <em>incompatible</em> change. But, given how useless the previous JSON reports were, hopefully this will not affect too many people.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.5.3:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the Ruport dependency (Neil Matatall)</li>
<li>Add more informational JSON output (Neil Matatall)</li>
<li>Add comparison to previous JSON report (Neil Matatall)</li>
<li>Add highlighting of dangerous values in HTML/text reports</li>
<li><code>Model#update_attribute</code> should not raise mass assignment warning (Dave Worth)</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t check <code>find_by_*</code> method for SQL injection</li>
<li>Fix duplicate reporting of mass assignment and SQL injection</li>
<li>Fix rescanning of deleted files</li>
<li>Properly check for <code>rails_xss</code> in Gemfile</li>
</ul>


<h3>No More Ruport</h3>

<p>Ruport is a nice library, but it also has not been updated in over two years and its dependency tree was ridiculous.</p>

<p>Thanks to Neil Matatall, Brakeman no longer depends on Ruport, but the reports should look essentially the same. The HTML reports are now rendered through ERB templates, so it should not be too difficult to customize the reports if desired.</p>

<h3>Better JSON Output</h3>

<p>JSON output now includes meta-information about the scan, errors raised during the scan, and line numbers for each warning.</p>

<h3>JSON Report Comparison</h3>

<p>Being able to compare Brakeman reports is essential for tracking warnings over time. Prior to this release, the only decent way of doing that was via the <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/docs/jenkins/">Jenkins plugin</a>. But now Brakeman can compare results to the JSON report from a previous scan.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>brakeman -o report.json
brakeman --compare report.json
</code></pre>

<p>This will run another scan, then output a comparison of the reports (in JSON). The report includes a list of fixed warnings and a list of new warnings that were found.</p>

<h3>User Input Highlighted in Reports</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is unclear exactly what value has caused Brakeman to issue a particular warning. This release adds highlighting the detected user input in most warnings. (Some warnings, the code that is reported <em>is</em> the detected user input). This information is also available in the JSON reports.</p>

<p><img src="/images/user_input_highlight.png" title="Example of User Input Highlighting" alt="User Input Highlight" /></p>

<h3>Fewer Mass Assignment and SQL Injection Methods</h3>

<p>Dave Worth pointed out that Brakeman was a little overzealous in which methods it considered susceptible to mass assignment and SQL injection attacks.</p>

<p>Brakeman will no longer check <code>update_attribute</code> for mass assignment or the <code>find_by_*</code> dynamic methods for SQL injection.</p>

<h3>Fewer Mass Assignment and SQL Injection Duplicates</h3>

<p>Pesky duplicate reports of mass assignment and SQL injection were turning up as template warnings. This occurred when the results of the mass assignment or SQL query were assigned to a variable which was then used in a template. This should now be fixed.</p>

<p>More details than are probably desired are available <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/82">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Rescanning Fixes</h3>

<p>Rescanning of deleted files is now supported, and there some other issues with rescanning that are now resolved as well.</p>

<h3>New Logo</h3>

<p>Brakeman has a sweet new logo, thanks to <a href="http://janellelawless.com/">Janelle Lawless</a>!</p>

<p><img src="/images/logo_medium.png" alt="Brakeman Logo" /></p>

<p>Updates to the website to reflect this awesomeness are coming soon.</p>

<h3>Reporting Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues">issues</a> with this release!</p>

<p>Also consider joining the <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/contact/">mailing list</a> or following <a href="https://twitter.com/brakeman">@brakeman</a> on Twitter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A considerable number of bugs and odd cases have been fixed with this release, and one new check has been added. Upgrading is <em>always</em> recommended!</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.5.2:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Add check for user input in <code>Object#send</code> (Neil Matatall)</li>
<li>Support output to multiple formats (Nick Green)</li>
<li>Prevent infinite loops in mutually recursive templates</li>
<li>Only check <code>eval</code> arguments for user input, not the call target</li>
<li>Handle <code>render :layout</code> in views</li>
<li>Search subdirectories for models</li>
<li>Set values in request hashes and propagate to views</li>
<li>Add rake task file to gemspec (Anton Ageev)</li>
<li>Filter rescanning of templates (Neil Matatall)</li>
<li>Improve handling of modules and nesting</li>
<li>Test for zero errors in test reports</li>
</ul>


<h3>New Check for User Input in Object#send</h3>

<p>This new check looks for instances where user input can be used to control the method called using <code>send</code>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>user = User.find(params[:user][:id])
method = params[:user][:action].to_sym
user.send(method)
</code></pre>

<h3>Support for Multiple Output Formats</h3>

<p>Brakeman can now accept multiple <code>-o</code> arguments in order to produce more than one report from the same scan:</p>

<pre><code>brakeman -o report.html -o report.json
</code></pre>

<h3>Handle Mutually Recursive Templates</h3>

<p>In some cases where two templates would render each other as partials, it would cause infinite loops in Brakeman. This is now fixed, at least for the simple common case:</p>

<p>_one.erb.html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= render :partial =&gt; 'two' %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>_two.erb.html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= render :partial =&gt; 'one' %&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Only Check <code>eval</code> Arguments</h3>

<p>Previously, Brakeman was checking the entire call to methods like <code>eval</code> or <code>class_eval</code> for user input. This led to false positives when <code>class_eval</code> was being called on a model.</p>

<p>Now Brakeman only checks the arguments or block provided to the <code>eval</code> call.</p>

<h3>Handle render :layout in views</h3>

<p>Brakeman was not handling <code>render :layout =&gt; "..."</code> in views properly. This led to errors like:</p>

<pre><code>wrong number of arguments (0 for 1): /Users/collins/work/brakeman/lib/brakeman/processors/lib/render_helper.rb:14:in `template_name
</code></pre>

<p><code>render :layout</code> is now handled just like rendering a partial.</p>

<h3>Search for Models in Subdirectories</h3>

<p>Brakeman was only searching <code>app/models/</code> for models, but not any subdirectories. Now it does!</p>

<h3>Propagate Request Values</h3>

<p>While Brakeman has always detected request values (e.g., query parameters) in views, it would not propagate values stored IN those request hashes.</p>

<p>For example, if an action in a controller did this:</p>

<pre><code>params[:input] = some_random_value
</code></pre>

<p>That value would not be propagated to the view if the view used <code>params[:input]</code>.</p>

<h3>Add Rake Task to Gemspec</h3>

<p>In 1.2.0, Brakeman added the <code>--rake</code> option to add a Rake task to a Rails application, but the actual task itself was not included in the gem!</p>

<p>Thanks to Anton Ageev for pointing this out. Either no one else tried this option, or a lot of people were very disappointed.</p>

<h3>Filter Templates When Rescanning</h3>

<p>When rescanning (for example, with <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard-brakeman">guard-brakeman</a>), Brakeman was assuming any files in <code>app/views</code> is a template, but this isn&#8217;t always true.</p>

<h3>Reporting Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues">issues</a>!</p>

<p>Also consider joining the <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/contact/">mailing list</a> or following <a href="https://twitter.com/brakeman">@brakeman</a> on Twitter.</p>

<p>And don&#8217;t forget to check out the Brakeman talk at <a href="http://railsconf2012.com/sessions/44">RailsConf</a> later this month.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is update includes some important fixes. All users of the <code>rails_xss</code> plugin are particularly encouraged to upgrade.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.5.1:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix handling of views when using <code>rails_xss</code></li>
<li>Fix rescanning of lib files (Neil Matatall)</li>
<li>Fix <code>link_to</code> checks for Rails 2.0 and 2.3</li>
<li>Revert to <code>ruby_parser</code> 2.3.1 for Ruby 1.8 parsing</li>
<li>Only warn on user input in render paths</li>
<li>Output stack trace on interrupt when debugging</li>
<li>Ignore user input in if statement conditions</li>
<li>Fix &#8211;skip-files option with Ruby 1.8</li>
</ul>


<h3>Views with rails_xss</h3>

<p>Some previous changes to make sure Brakeman was processing ERB views the same way as the <code>rails_xss</code> plugin unfortunately broke the processing of those views.</p>

<p>These changes caused Brakeman to not report <em>any</em> output from ERB views when the <code>rails_xss</code> plugin was in use, hiding any XSS vulnerabilities in those views.</p>

<p>This now fixed, so if you are using the <code>rails_xss</code> plugin, it is highly recommended to upgrade.</p>

<h3>Rescanning lib/ Files</h3>

<p>Rescanning changed files in the <code>lib</code> directory was broken, but Neil fixed it!</p>

<h3>link_to Checks</h3>

<p>In Rails 2.3, the URL is escaped, but not the body of the link. In Rails 2.0, neither argument is escaped.</p>

<p>In this release, the check for XSS in <code>link_to</code> has been updated to handle <code>link_to</code> with blocks and to warn in Rails 2.0.x if any user input is used as an argument.</p>

<h3>Revert to ruby_parser for Ruby 1.8</h3>

<p>Brakeman has been using a vendored version of <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby_parser">ruby_parser</a> with some updates to Ruby 1.9 syntax parsing. Unfortunately, that version also introduced some regressions for parsing Ruby 1.8 syntax.</p>

<p>To handle this, Brakeman will now only use the vendored version for 1.9 parsing, but the regular gem version for 1.8 syntax parsing. This should fix some parse errors people are seeing for Ruby 1.8 apps.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Render Path Updates</h3>

<p>The check for dynamic render paths was not very good, but it is better now. &#8220;Dynamic Render Path&#8221; warnings should only be raised when user input is actually used to determine what view, partial, or file to render.</p>

<h3>Stacktrace Output</h3>

<p>Brakeman will now output a stacktrace if interrupted while running with the <code>-d</code> option. This is mostly helpful when Brakeman appears to &#8220;hang&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Reporting Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues">issues</a>!</p>

<p>Also consider joining the <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/contact/">mailing list</a> or following <a href="https://twitter.com/brakeman">@brakeman</a> on Twitter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After the excitment yesterday with a mass assignment vulnerability being exploited in a very public manner on <a href="https://gist.github.com/1978249">Github</a>, interest in Brakeman has skyrocketed.</p>

<p>This lead to re-examination of Brakeman&#8217;s code for detecting that mass assignment has been globally disabled - and it turns out there was a bug or two. So here is a bug-fix release of Brakeman to correct that and some other minor issues.</p>

<p>Upgrading to 1.5.1 may increase the number of warnings reported.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.5.0</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix detection of global mass assignment setting</li>
<li>Fix partial rendering in Rails 3</li>
<li>Show backtrace when interrupt received (Ruby 1.9 only)</li>
<li>More debug output</li>
<li>Internal fixes:

<ul>
<li>Remove duplicate method in Brakeman::Rails2XSSErubis</li>
<li>Add tracking of module and class to Brakeman::BaseProcessor</li>
<li>Report module when using Brakeman::FindCall</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Mass Assignment</h3>

<p>Mass assignment is not a particularly new issue, but the amount of attention suddenly focused on it this weekend was amazing.</p>

<p>This release of Brakeman can detect three different methods for defaulting all models to a whitelist of allowed attributes that can be mass assigned.</p>

<p>The first is probably the most widely-seen version. In an intializer, do</p>

<pre><code>ActiveRecord::Base.send(:attr_accessible, nil)
</code></pre>

<p>The second is essentially equivalent, but 1.5.1 adds support for it as well:</p>

<pre><code>module ActiveRecord
  class Base
    attr_accessible nil
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The third option is only available for Rails 3.1.0 and newer. The following configuration setting can be added to <code>application.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>config.active_record.whitelist_attributes = true
</code></pre>

<p>Brakeman should correctly detect all of these.</p>

<p><a href="http://pragtob.wordpress.com/2012/03/06/secure-your-rails-apps/">This is a very nice post</a> explaining the dangers of mass assignment (mentioning Brakeman is nice, too.)</p>

<h3>Partials in Rails 3</h3>

<p>In Rails 3, <code>render 'blah'</code> is now equivalent to <code>render :partial =&gt; 'blah'</code> when used inside a template.</p>

<p>Brakeman now supports this correctly.</p>

<h3>Debug Output</h3>

<p>More debugging output has been added for use with the <code>-d</code> option.</p>

<p>Additionally, when interrupting the application (for example, with <code>^C</code>), a stack trace will be output. Please note, however, that this only works with Ruby 1.9.</p>

<h3>Internal Changes</h3>

<p>There have been a few internal changes. There is a possibility that these will affect some warnings. However, it should only result in accurate reporting of class names.</p>

<h3>Report Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any problems on <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues">Github</a>!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A release was forced today because two new Rails vulnerabilities were reported (the first since November):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/9da0c515a6c4664">Manual options are not escaped in select()</a></li>
<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/edd28f1e3d04e913">Some operations on SafeBuffer mistakenly return strings marked as html_safe</a></li>
</ul>


<p>This release includes checks for these two vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>There is also a new check for skipping CSRF token verification, and some other changes which may result in fewer or more vulnerabilities being reported.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.4.0:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Add version check for SafeBuffer vulnerability</li>
<li>Add check for select vulnerability in Rails 3</li>
<li>select() is no longer considered safe in Rails 2</li>
<li>Add check for skipping CSRF protection with a blacklist</li>
<li>Add JSON report format</li>
<li>Model#id should not be considered XSS</li>
<li>Standardize methods to check for SQL injection</li>
<li>Fix Rails 2 route parsing issue with nested routes</li>
</ul>


<h3>Check for SafeBuffer Vulnerability</h3>

<p>A new vulnerability was reported that affects strings which are marked as <code>html_safe</code> and then modified in some way. For some operations, the new, modified string will still be marked as <code>html_safe</code>. Full details <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/edd28f1e3d04e913">here</a>.</p>

<p>For this vulnerability, Brakeman only does a version check and reports if an application is used a vulnerable version of Rails. It only reports on Rails 3 applications, since Rails 3 introduced the concept of SafeBuffers.</p>

<h3>Check for select Helper Vulnerability</h3>

<p>Another vulnerability was reported today in the <code>select</code> form helper. Option tags built by hand (interpolating values into <code>&lt;option&gt;&lt;/option&gt;</code>) will not be escaped by <code>select</code>. Full details <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/9da0c515a6c4664">here</a>.</p>

<p>For Rails 3 applications, Brakeman checks for uses of <code>select</code> which have user input in the <code>options</code> argument. This check may be refined in the future.</p>

<p>For Rails 2, Brakeman no longer considers <code>select</code> a safe method when checking for cross site scripting.</p>

<h3>Check for CSRF Filter Skipping</h3>

<p>When cross site request forgery protection is enabled, a <code>before_filter</code> is added called <code>verify_authenticity_token</code>. This filter checks that actions called responding to a <code>POST</code> have a correct authenticity token from the client. Since this is a regular <code>before_filter</code>, it can be skipped using <code>skip_before_filter</code>.</p>

<p>If <code>skip_before_filter</code> is called using an <code>:except</code> option, then the default for the controller becomes NOT checking for an authenticity token:</p>

<pre><code>skip_before_filter :verify_authenticity_token, :except =&gt; [:create, :delete]
</code></pre>

<p>It is recommended to use <code>:only</code> if skipping this filter is actually necessary. This way, any new actions added later will automatically fall under the CSRF protection.</p>

<p>This check may be extended in the future to other important filters.</p>

<h3>JSON Report Format</h3>

<p>While the code for outputting JSON was in the 1.4.0 release, it was not actually added as a proper output format! This has been rectified.</p>

<p><code>-f json</code> or <code>-o report.json</code> will now produce JSON reports.</p>

<p>The information contained in these reports may change in the future, although that should only be adding more information.</p>

<h3>SQL Methods</h3>

<p>The code for finding SQL methods to check for SQL injection was a little messed up. Depending on how the method was called, different sets of methods were considered dangerous.</p>

<p>This has been changed for better consistency and coverage. This means reports may include new SQL injections, so keep an eye out.</p>

<h3>Rails 2 Route Parsing Fix</h3>

<p>There was a bug in the code which determined if a method was being called on <code>map</code>, which caused Brakeman to think strange methods were route definitions (for example, <code>require</code>). This has been fixed.</p>

<h3>Report Problems!</h3>

<p>Always <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues">report problems</a> encountered when running Brakeman.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is not a big release, but it does add a new check. Also, processing for ERB templates with the <code>rails_xss</code> plugin has changed, so there is the possibility that line numbers for reported warnings will shift.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.3.0:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Add check for user input in link_to href parameter</li>
<li>Match ERB processing to rails_xss plugin when plugin used</li>
<li>Add Brakeman::Report#to_json, Brakeman::Warning#to_json</li>
<li>Warnings below minimum confidence are dropped completely</li>
<li>Brakeman.run will now always return a Tracker</li>
</ul>


<h3>New Check for link_to</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/oreoshake">Neil Matatall</a> has contributed a new check for the href parameter in <code>link_to</code>. Even if HTML escaped, some values can be dangerous, so this check will warn for user input in that parameter. See <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/45">here</a> for more details.</p>

<p>The <code>--url-safe-methods</code> option can be used to specify escaping methods which are safe for urls.</p>

<h3>ERB and rails_xss</h3>

<p>The <code>rails_xss</code> plugin has some fixes for how Erbuis handles certain input. Brakeman now matches those changes, which fixes some parsing errors.</p>

<h3>Internal Changes</h3>

<p>There have been some changes which only impact those working with Brakeman as a library.</p>

<p>First, there is now json output for reports. This actually should be an output format option, but I did not realize it until writing this post. The next release will include this, though!</p>

<p>The way Brakeman handles the <code>--confidence-level</code> option has also changed. In the past, warnings would be filtered when output in a report. This meant, for example, that <code>tracker.checks.all_warnings</code> would still return warnings below the specified confidence level. It also caused problems because there were many places in the code where the warnings needed to be filtered. With this release, warnings below the confidence level will be dropped as soon as they are found and will not need to be filtered at any later point.</p>

<p>Lastly, <code>Brakeman.run</code> would return <code>false</code> if <code>--exit-on-warn</code> was set, and a <code>Tracker</code> object otherwise. This has changed. <code>Brakeman.run</code> will now always return a <code>Tracker</code> object and the logic for <code>--exit-on-warn</code> was pushed out to the Brakeman executable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to everyone who reported problems and suggestions this time around!</p>

<p>This release includes some new features, better performance on large projects, and more detection criteria. Warnings reported may change after upgrading.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.2.2:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Add file paths to HTML report</li>
<li>Add caching of filters</li>
<li>Add <code>--skip-files</code> option</li>
<li>Add support for <code>attr_protected</code></li>
<li>Add detection of request.env as user input</li>
<li>Descriptions of checks in <code>-k</code> output</li>
<li>Improved processing of named scopes</li>
<li>Check for mass assignment in <code>ActiveRecord::Associations::AssociationCollection#build</code></li>
<li>Better variable substitution</li>
<li>Table output option for rescan reports</li>
</ul>


<h3>File Paths in HTML Report</h3>

<p>In the HTML output, any warning which has context associated with it (visible when clicking on the warning message) will now include the file name at the top of the code snippet.</p>

<h3>Filter Caching</h3>

<p>Filters (using <code>before_filter</code>) are now only parsed once, instead of for everytime they are used. This has greatly improved performance when scanning some large projects.</p>

<h3>Option to Skip Files</h3>

<p>A list of files to skip can be provided with the <code>--skip-files</code> option. This will skip any initializers, libraries, controllers, models, or views that match the file names provided. The file names to skip are matched against the end of the absolute path. That is, <code>blah.rb</code> will skip <em>any</em> file with a name ending in <code>blah.rb</code>. This means it is not necessary to provide the full path to a file.</p>

<h3>Support for Blacklisting Attributes</h3>

<p>Previously, Brakeman ignored uses of <code>attr_protected</code>. Ideally, <code>attr_accessible</code> should always be used to whitelist attributes that can be set using mass assignment. This way, attributes can never be &#8220;accidentally&#8221; exposed. However, it can also be tedious for large models.</p>

<p>With this release, Brakeman will downgrade mass assignment warnings to &#8220;weak&#8221; confidence if <code>attr_protected</code> is used, as well as suggesting that <code>attr_accessible</code> be used instead.</p>

<p>The <code>--ignore-protected</code> option can be used to suppress any warnings for models that use <code>attr_protected</code>.</p>

<h3>Request Environment is User Input</h3>

<p><code>request.env</code> will now be treated as user input.</p>

<h3>Check Descriptions</h3>

<p>The <code>-k</code> option now includes descriptions of each check.</p>

<h3>Named Scope Improvements</h3>

<p>The 1.2.0 release added checking for SQL injection in named scopes, but it was not very accurate. This has been improved.</p>

<h3>Better Variable Substitution</h3>

<p>Variable substitution would sometimes &#8220;explode&#8221; if a set of code was processed for aliasing several times.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre><code>x = clean(x)

puts x
</code></pre>

<p>Might become</p>

<pre><code>x = clean(x)

puts clean(clean(clean(clean(x))))
</code></pre>

<p>This should now be prevented, so it would just become</p>

<pre><code>x = clean(x)

puts clean(x)
</code></pre>

<p>There may be subtle issues with this code (although I have not seen any yet), but it&#8217;s better than creating a bunch of useless substitutions.</p>

<h3>Table Output for Rescan Reports</h3>

<p><code>RescanReport#to_s(true)</code> will now output formatted tables, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/33">Dave Worth</a>.</p>

<h3>Issues?</h3>

<p>As usual, please report any issues on <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues">GitHub</a>, send a tweet to <a href="https://twitter.com/brakeman">@Brakeman</a>, or send an email to the <a href="http://librelist.com/browser/brakeman/">mailing list</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Changes since 1.2.1:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>&#8211;no-progress works again</li>
<li>Make CheckLinkTo a separate check</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t fail on unknown options to resource(s)</li>
<li>Handle empty resource(s) blocks</li>
<li>Add RescanReport#existing_warnings</li>
</ul>


<h3>No Progress Option</h3>

<p>The last release broke the <code>--no-progress</code> option for hiding the <code>1/100 files processed</code> type messages. Now it works again!</p>

<h3>Separate Check for link_to</h3>

<p>For no great reason, <code>CheckLinkTo</code> was bundled with <code>CheckCrossSiteScripting</code>. It has now been moved out to a separate file, allowing it to be treated as a regular check. This means it can be explicitly skipped using <code>-x CheckLinkTo</code> (if desired).</p>

<h3>Better Rails 2 Route Handling</h3>

<p>Brakeman was raising an exception if a hash option to <code>resource</code> or <code>resources</code> did not match a set of known options. Now it will only warn instead of aborting route processing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is essentially just a bugfix release, but due to the fixes for <code>link_to</code> warnings, there is a good possibility the number of reported warnings will decrease when upgrading to this version.</p>

<p>Changes since 1.2.0:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove link_to warning for Rails 3.x or when using rails_xss</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t warn if first argument to link_to is escaped</li>
<li>Detect usage of attr_accessible with no arguments</li>
<li>Fix error when rendering a partial from a view but not through a controller</li>
<li>Fix some issues with rails_xss, CheckCrossSiteScripting, and CheckTranslateBug</li>
<li>Simplify Brakeman Rake task</li>
<li>Avoid modifying $VERBOSE</li>
<li>Add Brakeman::RescanReport#to_s</li>
<li>Add Brakeman::Warning#to_s</li>
</ul>


<h3>link_to Changes</h3>

<p>Prior to Rails 3.0, there <a href="https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/3518-link_to-doesnt-escape-its-input">was a bug</a> in <code>link_to</code> that caused the body of the link tag to be output without escaping. While this was fixed in Rails 3.0, Brakeman has still been warning on it. This was also fixed in the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails_xss/commit/afc1610fe4b94150faee98c16f15a24290d20900">rails_xss</a>, so Brakeman should no longer warn on <code>link_to</code> for Rails 2.x when using the rails_xss plugin.</p>

<p>Brakeman was also warning on <code>link_to</code> even if the body argument was manually escaped. This should be resolved now.</p>

<p>One other related issue was a silly bug causing Brakeman to sometimes ignore <code>--escape-html</code> or the rails_xss plugin, leading to some confusing output. This is fixed.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/32">Neil Matatall</a> for reporting the <code>link_to</code> issue and <a href="https://github.com/a5sk4s">Andreas</a> for reporting the rails_xss problems.</p>

<h3>attr_accessible with No Arguments</h3>

<p>Brakeman was not detecting the case where <code>attr_accessible</code> is called with zero arguments, causing spurious mass assignment warnings.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/31">Justin Wiley</a> for reporting this.</p>

<h3>Brakeman Rake Task</h3>

<p>The Brakeman Rake task (installed via <code>--rake</code>) is even <a href="/docs/rake">simpler now</a>.</p>

<h3>$VERBOSE</h3>

<p>Brakeman was using <code>$VERBOSE</code> and <code>Kernel.warn</code> for controlling debug output. This has changed and <code>$VERBOSE</code> will no longer be modified when using Brakeman.</p>

<h3>Rails 3.2 Support</h3>

<p>So far, there have not been any issues with Brakeman and Rails 3.2. Please <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues">report</a> any that come up!</p>

<h3>JRuby Performance</h3>

<p>Prior to Brakeman 1.2, <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a> was very slow when running Brakeman. This has changed, and now JRuby is probably the fastest option for scanning large applications. Give it a try, especially if you are using Ruby 1.8.7!</p>

<h3>Mailing List</h3>

<p>There is now a Brakeman mailing list on <a href="http://librelist.com/browser/brakeman/">librelist</a>.</p>
